          <section>

            <p>Version control allows you (and your team) to do two powerful things:</p>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Track and revert changes</h4>
              <p>Mistakes happen. Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the changes that have been made and go "back in time" to fix something that went wrong?
            </div>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Collaborate</h4>

            <p><span class="green">1990s</span> -- CVS (Concurrent Version Systems)</p>
            <p><span class="green">2000s</span> -- SVN (Apache Subversion)</p>
            <p><span class="green">2005</span> -- Git (well, Git)</p>

            <h3>Version Control Types</h3>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Centralized Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: CVS, SVN</p>
              <p>One central server, each client (person) checks out and merges changes to main server</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Distributed Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: Git, Mercurial</p>
              <p>Each client (person) has a local repository, which they can then reconcile with the main server.</p>

          <p>Goals of Git Design</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fast -- add to your team and code base quickly</li>
            <li>Distributed (see slide above) - you can work without a network connection </li>
            <li>Each commit has a unique identifier, a SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm, a.k.a hash)</li>
            <li>Everyone has a local copy of the history</li>

          <p>An SSH key is like a secret handshake between your computer and Github. It allows Github's servers to verify your identity via public-key cryptography and challenge-response authentication- not via you typing in your Github password. It's super secure and not too difficult to set up. </p>

          <h3>Your first Local Repository</h3>

# create and move to a "working directory"

        <section>
          <h3>Add files</h3>
          <p>Create a new <code>hello.txt</code> file in your <code>my-repo</code> directory, then check repo status</p>

        <!-- Explanation-->
        <section>
          <h3>What did we just do??</h3>
          <p>How is this all different than just saving a file?</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">When we <span class="green">add</span> a file, we tell Git to track the current state of it. This is also known as 'staging' the file.</li>
            <li class="fragment">A <span class="green">commit</span> saves changes made to staged files, not the whole files. The commit allows us to track which changes were committed when and by whom.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Look at our progress</h3>

          <p>Cool! We'll be using that SHA later...</p>

          <h3>Git is helpful</h3>
          <p>Always read the output of running git commands. They may look a little intimidating, but they contain all sorts of useful information. When in doubt, run:</p>
          <pre><code class="command-line">
git status
        </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Git flow</h3>
          <p>This is the general workflow in a Git repository</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git init            #just once, to initialize
      #do some stuff to files

          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Un-stage a file</h4>
          <p>If you already staged hello.txt, run:</p>

git reset hello.txt

          <p><code>hello.txt</code> is no longer staged, you can make whatever changes you like to it, and re-stage when it's ready.</p>

          <h4>Delete a staged file</h4>

          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git rm -f hello.txt
          </code></pre>
          <p>The file is deleted, and its deletion will be part of your commit.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undo staged changes</h4> 
            <p>If you've made some changes to <code>hello.txt</code> and staged it, but want the changes to disappear, run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git reset hello.txt     #unstage
git checkout hello.txt  #reset
            </code></pre>
          <p><code>hello.txt</code> is unstaged and reset to its state at the last commit - your changes are gone!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing committed changes- 1</h4> 
          <div>
            <p>If you've made changes and committed them, you can revert all the changes that happened in a specific commit by running:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git log             #shows log of commits 
git revert [SHA]    #undoes specified commit
            </code></pre>
            <p>This doesn't have to be your most recent commit- you can revert any commit. It will just undo the entire set of changes that were included in that commit.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing committed changes- 2</h4> 
          <div>
            <p>You can roll back your repo's state to where it was after any previous commit by running this with the SHA of the commit you'd like to reset to:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git log                 #shows log of commits 
git reset --hard [SHA]  #resets repo 
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This rolls back all changes since the specified commit - be careful! This isn't often used in real life.</p>

            While a README isn't a required part of a GitHub repository, it is a very good idea to have one. READMEs are a great place to describe your project or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. You might want to include contact information–if your project becomes popular people will want to help you out.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/FORKED-REPO-NAME.git
# creates a remote connection, called "upstream", to the original repo on Github
