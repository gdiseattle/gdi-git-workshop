          <section>
            <h3>What Is Version Control?</h3>
            <p>Version control allows you (and your team) to do two powerful things:</p>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Track And Revert Changes</h4>
              <p>Mistakes happen. Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the changes that have been made and go "back in time" to fix something that went wrong?
            </div>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Collaborate</h4>
              <p>Create anything with other people, from academic papers to entire websites and applications.</p>

            <h3>Brief History Of Version Control</h3>
            <p><span class="green">1990s</span> -- CVS (Concurrent Version Systems)</p>
            <p><span class="green">2000s</span> -- SVN (Apache Subversion)</p>
            <p><span class="green">2005</span> -- Git (well, Git)</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Version Control Types</h3>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Centralized Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: CVS, SVN</p>
              <p>One central server, each client (person) checks out and merges changes to main server</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Distributed Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: Git, Mercurial</p>
              <p>Each client (person) has a local repository, which they can then reconcile with the main server.</p>

          <p>Goals of Git Design</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fast -- add to your team and code base quickly</li>
            <li>Distributed (see slide above) - you can work without a network connection </li>
            <li>Each commit has a unique identifier, a SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm, a.k.a hash)</li>
            <li>Everyone has a local copy of the history</li>

          <h3>Installation And Setup</h3>
          <p>An SSH key is like a secret handshake between your computer and Github. It allows Github's servers to verify your identity via public-key cryptography and challenge-response authentication- not via you typing in your Github password. It's super secure and not too difficult to set up. </p>

        <!-- First commands-->
        <section>
          <h3>Your First Local Repository</h3>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
# Change to your home directory
cd ~

# OR
cd

# Create and move to a "working directory"
mkdir my-repo

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Add Files</h3>
          <p>Create a new <code>hello.txt</code> file in your <code>my-repo</code> directory, then check repo status</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">

        <!-- Explanation-->
        <section>
          <h3>What Did We Just Do?</h3>
          <p>How is this all different than just saving a file?</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">When we <span class="green">add</span> a file, we tell Git to track the current state of it. This is also known as 'staging' the file.</li>
            <li class="fragment">A <span class="green">commit</span> saves changes made to staged files, not the whole files. The commit allows us to track which changes were committed when and by whom.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Look At Our Progress</h3>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git log

        <section>
          <h3>Git Is Helpful</h3>
          <p>Always read the output of running git commands. They may look a little intimidating, but they contain all sorts of useful information. When in doubt, run:</p>
          <pre><code class="command-line">
git status
        </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Basic Git Worklow</h3>
          <p>This is the general workflow in a Git repository</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git init            # Just once, to initialize
      # Do some stuff to files
git status          # What's up, git?
git add [filename]  # Stage changes to a file
git commit -m ""    # Commit a set of changes
git status          # What's up, git?

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing Local Changes</h4>
          <div>
            <p>If you've added some new text to <code>hello.txt</code>, but not yet staged it, just run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git checkout hello.txt 
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p class="fragment"><code>hello.txt</code> is reset to its state at the last commit - your changes are gone!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Un-stage a file</h4>
          <p>If you already staged hello.txt, run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git reset hello.txt 
            </code></pre>
          <p><code>hello.txt</code> is no longer staged, you can make whatever changes you like to it, and re-stage when it's ready.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Delete A Staged File</h4>
          <p>If you've already staged <code>hello.txt</code>, but want to delete it instead, run:</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git rm -f hello.txt
          </code></pre>
          <p>The file is deleted, and its deletion will be part of your commit.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undo staged changes</h4>
            <p>If you've made some changes to <code>hello.txt</code> and staged it, but want the changes to disappear, run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git reset hello.txt     # Unstage
git checkout hello.txt  # Undo all my local changes
            </code></pre>
          <p><code>hello.txt</code> is unstaged and reset to its state at the last commit - your changes are gone!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing committed changes: Part 1</h4>
          <div>
            <p>If you've made changes and committed them, you can revert all the changes that happened in a specific commit by running:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git log           # Display log of commits
git revert [SHA]  # Un-does specified commit with opposite changes
            </code></pre>
            <p>This doesn't have to be your most recent commit- you can revert any commit. It will just undo the entire set of changes that were included in that commit.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing Committed Changes: Part 2</h4>
          <div>
            <p>You can roll back your repo's state to where it was after any previous commit by running this with the SHA of the commit you'd like to reset to:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git log                  # Display log of commits
git reset --hard [SHA]   # Reset the repo
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This rolls back all changes since the specified commit - be careful! This isn't often used in real life.</p>

            While a README isn't a required part of a GitHub repository, it is a very good idea to have one. READMEs are a great place to describe your project or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. You might want to include contact information–if your project becomes popular people will want to help you out.

          <h3>Forking</h3>
          <h4>Cloning</h4>
          <p>Navigate to the location you want new directory to be in- NOT INSIDE ANOTHER GIT REPO! Then, clone to get a local repository of your fork.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="command-line">
git clone https://github.com/username/FORKED-REPO-NAME.git

cd FORKED-REPO-NAME

        <h3>Cloning</h3>
          <p>The <code>git clone</code> command does a lot!<p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creates a local directory for the repo</li>
              <li>Initializes that directory as a Git repo</li>
              <li>Adds a remote connection called <code>origin</code> to the Github repo it was cloned from</li>
              <li>Pulls from the Github repo so it's perfectly up-to-date</li>
            </ul>            
        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>Cloning</h3>
        <p>Add a remote connection to the <strong>original</strong> repository, so you can stay up to date with their changes:</p>
        <pre><code class="command-line">
# Creates a remote connection, called "upstream",
#   to the original repo on Github
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/FORKED-REPO-NAME.git

# Pulls in changes not present in your local repository,
#   without modifying your files
git fetch upstream
        </code></pre>

        <section>
          <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After you fork and clone a repository, all pushed changes will go to <strong>your</strong> fork</li>
            <li>These changes will not affect the original repository</li>
            <li>If you would like to get your changes to be incorporated into the original repo, you can submit a pull request</li>
          </ul>
